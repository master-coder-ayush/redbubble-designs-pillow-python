The world's a hard place, Danny. It don't care. It don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they're things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems like it's only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don't love you, but your momma does and so do I.

It hurts to let go, to say goodbye for the final time and remain distant in your closure, it may even tear your heart out to the point of insanity; but somehow in it all you find the pieces of your worth and you start creating yourself again, and in that journey of transformation you find the essence of what truly matters, inner happiness. It's life, we all fall at some stage but it's up to you, to decide how long you want to stay there.

I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living.

Now, that is what I know for sure.

This is how it is in life and love. In life and love we are with people for a while, and then we join other people, people we have not met, and we walk with them, and we leave behind all the things we used to be.

Flowers that are offered for the dead, do not know the difference of where their beauty will be placed, they do not say, "This is not a palace" or "This is not a garden"; they just are. They are just beautiful, without giving regards to whether they are placed on a grave or in a castle. Flowers are just beautiful, whether they grow by the wayside or in a manicured garden. If we were all like flowers, then we would all be beautiful, with no regards to why or how. We just are. We are just beautiful.

Munia Khan
Always remember that the most valuable thing that you can do in this world, is to live a life of love. Love truly those who were given you to be loved. Love truly the gifts you were given in life, as well as your ability to live and share those gifts. Even if the only people who remember your name, are the five people you have loved and who have loved you in this life, that makes you no less important than the person who is recognised by every individual in this world! In seeking to change the world out there that you live in, do make sure that you are not changing it in order to make it become more like you; rather, live to change yourself, to know yourself, to grow and to become. This is the highest reach of man. The downfall of world-changers in this day and age, is that those who wish to change the world, only wish to influence the world of their own beliefs, choices, and opinions. But this is not how the world is changed. This planet is changed, only when we heal and grow and know the worlds within ourselves. Because it is in the healing of worlds unique and innumerable, that this one we share will find her hope. The only person who needs to know you, is you. And then the people who are given to you to love, who love you truly in return. — The Conversation of Venusta

Aaron Dennis
There are so many bad people in the world. They'll treat you badly, they'll haggle and undermine your worth. They'll calculate what they can get without thinking about what to give. That's the world. Very seldom, you'll find someone who will not undermine and haggle your worth, who will take risks for you, who will think about what they can give to you and how they can make you happy. So you see, the rule goes like this— when you find such a person, you don't let go of them. You stay with them and they stay with you.

The world seems to want us to be sad and angry because bad things frequently happen. But I say we should feel the opposite. We should be happy and cheerful because good things happen. We should be delighted to see the sun rise and stars glow and rainbows color stormy skies. We should savor every simple breath and eat each meal with gratitude. We should slumber in sweet dreams and relish moments of laughter and love. We should take more notice of the joys and kindnesses that do exist, still dictating the actions of millions of good people all over the world. Life is filled with pleasant moments, not just grief. We should be happy because this is true.

End.How could I call it an end when there was no finite point. We were in a place beyond time with endless skies. And well, we fell. Feeling like a flightless bird trying to reach high.

Flashed with greed. Lost their sense of humanity.The beginning was better than this.

What else are pride, greed and such but money’s minions?
B.S. Murthy
Why is life hard on some while being soft on others? It would appear as if it feels a monotonous regimen would bore people to death, thereby bringing the creation to an unintended end. So, for the larger good of mankind, it could be constrained to contrive individual inequities to keep alive the general interest in it. Wonder how it prepares the black list for the fate to act upon! As all are dear to it were it not possible that blindfolded, it would go in for random selection with a sinking heart! And once fate gets hold of life’s blacklist, won’t weddings come in handy for it to impart misery in many wrong permutations and provide bliss in a few right combinations!

Some say Karma is a bitch. It all comes back to you, eventually. If this world can be boiled down to two truths. It would be the second law of thermodynamics (entropy) and the law of action and reaction (Karma). Well, if Karma really makes up the fabric of this Universe, if it is really a bitch, then prove it in this life itself! Why wait for reincarnation? Do you think I would be me once I die and transition to another body? No! What makes me, me, are my memories.

Garima Soni - words world
Emotions are never a problem! The problem is our biased attitude towards emotions. Since childhood we're taught to categorize emotions into 'good' and 'bad' and participate in the never-ending race of sieving out bad emotions and conquering the good - happiness, to be more specific. Whereas, sadness, anger, enthusiasm, anxiety, fear, confidence, or the state of being disconnected are all different forms of emotions and are equally important for our existence as human beings. Would you call a person who laughs the whole day and is happy about everything hundred percent sane? Rather than spending each moment of our lives until death to just 'live happily ever after', it would be much easier to just learn to accept our emotions and cherish them. You can't just paint your canvas with a single color and call it a modern art!

There is someone special for everyone.  Often there are two or three or even four. They come from different enerations. They travel across oceans of time and the depths of heavenly dimensions to be with you again. They come from the other side, from heaven. They look different, but your heart knows them. Your heart has held them in arms like yours in the moon-filled deserts of Egypt and the ancient plains of Mongolia. You have ridden together in the armies of forgotten warrior-generals, and you have lived together in the sand-covered caves of the Ancient Ones. You are bonded together throughout eternity, and you will never be alone.

Mehmet Murat ildan
Does a lack of life always equate to death? Perhaps it’s sometimes worse than that. For us, back then, it was. We were living an exiguity, an insufficiency which painfully demanded compensation, but to compensate for it we had nothing left. Silent. Perfectly silent as we were gliding across the icy earth. We didn't even leave traces anymore that could someday remind someone else that we had been there at all. How much does silence weigh and what amount of it can crush a man? However much: suddenly it was heavier on our shoulders. The silence, the air, the life that stuck to us like a tasteless chewing gum that we didn’t even want and all of a sudden, they ceased: the warm cloudlets, soaring into the icy air from my loosened lips. I stopped breathing.

The Earth is a testing ground for every one of us including the most prominent and of the most eminent ones.A place where we find duality in everything including how we see it and how it actually is in reality.Similarly, the duality concept is in people you see and meet who are either good, bad, or people who have two faces, one that they show and one that they are within.One is the duality of the personalities we veil through ourselves and another is the duality of the soul within.Whether are you a soul having fire within or are you a soul having light within and whichever you feed the most becomes your abode within and hereafter.You are both, your heaven and hell, fire and light, and finally, love or hate within.And our creator wants us to purify ourselves of the fire within and become light by being on the side of truth within and outside, righteousness within and outside, and pious within and outside, and finally sincere within and outside.Creator loves the one who has one tongue, one thing which is in the heart and which is on the tongue. The thing you are within is outside and the thing outside is within so you become successful.Like Rocky has said: “The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward."The matter is not that you have truth with you but the question is are you truthful?!.The truth will only set you free when you are truthful within yourself.

If you don't take action today you are failing to reach your goals and ultimately failing to create your life as you imagined it would be.You, me, or anyone out there, no one is aware of their future but what they are aware of is their present along with their preparation.You would need to build yourself brick by brick, growing your wall measuring feet after feet by laying a strong foundation of belief within yourself that no flood can wash away your dreams.You fall, you brush up, you get up, you look forward and rise back!

There is a phase in which we believe in others,What they have got to say, an opinion of them on us, for us or of other things in the world.And there is you who would believe everything been said and opinionated.And then one day you realize that all these things which you were made to believe are not actually the reality, or a part of it is distorted or the wholesome is.Then you begin to think and come out of that belief and believing.You set your paths right and clear, you believe what you experience and what is to be believed with certainty.You come out of your shell and explore the sun above your head.You start believing yourself, your intuitions, and yourself!
Aiyaz Uddin
If you are at the top, or at the position of authority or you are at the position to make or break something of yours or others.Remember doing good is a choice so is helping people in a way that makes them grow or helps them heal.Such a way that the wound is healed for which people remember you forever!On a road to life, one must ride with humility, empathy, and try to be a part of people's success, healing, or growth story.The world already has the negative so let's now change the way the world has handed over to us and heal what is wounded, repair what is broken, and attach with what is detached.
Aiyaz Uddin
You create your own happiness by creating your own moments and cherishing them to the core. In life, we rarely project ourselves and reflect which is where we miss ourselves. There is no other moment than now to hold tight to yourself otherwise time keeps on moving and you lose yourself to the world. Life isn’t a destination but a journey you decide for yourself through a deeper visualization and planning. Time is an ultimate currency that should be traded wisely with the deserving and no matter what and no matter how much you try to control things, meeting people’s expectations somewhere somehow you will be written wrong. Life is a precious gift from god! Celebrate yourself!

It's sad to live in this world and miss Heaven. But it's so sad, for God to miss us in His Kingdom despite having proven His love and having provided everything so that we couldn't miss it.

Darling listen - I want you to wake up now...Oh, no.. you took me otherwise. I am not asking you to wake up early today &amp; do the same thing you did yesterday, I want you to wake up in life... To wake up in life means to become more of yourself, to express yourself, to show the world how you're unique &amp; the best, everyday.To wake up in life means shifting your mindset from “Things happen to me” to “I make things happen”… It also means to remain happy with what you have while working hard for what you want.To wake up in life means putting a full stop to “watering the WEEDS” &amp; begin “watering the SEEDS”… It also means to stop over-dreaming &amp; under-acting.To wake up in life means shifting your mindset from “what is missing” to “what you’re grateful for”… &amp; giving your best shot to everything &amp; achieving every single thing you possibly CAN!Good luck &amp; Tons of Good Wishes!

Peace is white sun reflections on summer pear trees, and ocean mist droplets defying gravity by air currents. Peace is caffeinated goodbye-kissing and velvet smiles laced with credence. Trumpet horns sound off the coming of Blue Jays, Swallows and Chickadee’s. And there is no sadness echoing within or without. There is a taste of God in every grass blade and car horn raging in the city. The stop lights are all green, and there are children playing in the fountains. A dog laps my hand, and finally—I remembered what it’s all about.

Neha’s walk across the river felt excruciatingly long. Like a rubber band stretched to its limits.It is peculiar how moments of happiness and euphoria seem to pass over like greased lightning when compared to the ones filled with pain or anxiety. I often ask myself if happiness is genuinely fleeting or if we are hardwired to believe that human beings are born to suffer, and for that very reason tend to sadistically amplify and stretch our anxieties? Could our age old conditioning be in cahoots with Loki? Maybe, maybe not. I am still debating this, internally...

You haven't been loved well, until you've been loved just for sake of loving.Love is such a generous force.Being friends with opposite sex isn't always easy, but so very necessary for all of us, because at the end of the day we are all just humans in need of affection and care. And we are in need of caring, as much as being cared for.It is so very liberating to be in state of platonic, yet, nonetheless deep and honest love. It is compassion personified.The reason why I even mention opposite sex, is because, as a woman I truly value and enjoy company of great men. And it is often hard to allow men to be men, in sense of - their right to self expression, their right to be affectionate and protective and to embody all of those essential traits that make for a decent human being, without attaching a hidden agenda to their gestures of kindness and goodwill. Men, too, like to be of service. Men, too, like to be generous and kind - and God knows they are not only capable but also darn great at it.That's all there is to it, really.It is regrettable that often women don't feel safe in presence of men. Not so say that all men are the same, but truthfully, not all women are the same, either.I think, when we heal as a collective, this gap will no longer require bridging. I am, certainly, hoping for it.Friendship is the greatest gift we can gift to each others. But first, come acknowledgment and allowing ourselves to express our better nature without romanticizing or vilifying it.Love is meant for us all, no exceptions.

We believe we can control our lives as we want, but in truth, we never know what’s coming up. Hence, all we can do, in the end, is enjoy the moments given, pray, and hope for the better. We must always remember that everything will change, and every moment will pass, so it should be embraced whilst it is still within our grasp.

Do you see my diamond-studded smile and passion-filled eyes? It’s because I’m in that stage of my life where I have nothing to prove to anyone. There is no elaborate pretence and no lavish ostentations. Genuineness smoulders in yellow gold, and I carry integrity on my eyelids. I stitch virtue, ornately and intricately, in every feather of my powder silver wings, which thrusts me past the iridescent rainbow where my ambitions soar high amid the dappled blanket of the sky. This is I; the stronger me, the happier me and the empowered me.

The content structures of our existence, whether of mind or body, are helpful in our daily activities. Nevertheless, these can also be very manipulative and restrictive concerning conscious awakening. Thoughts and emotions can be excellent students of life. However, they cannot and should never be the teacher or master of this mystery.

Douglas Vigliotti
Here’s how I see it. You can break people up into three groups. The pre-midnight crowd, which is your average stiff. Saddled by their spouse, kids, and American idealism, easy to peg and rather uninteresting. Then, there’s the after-midnight crowd which is pretty interesting. They’re the people who can talk about the dark side, but not really go there, maybe they danced with it in college. But they still know how to have some fun. Then there’s the after 4am crowd that really opens your eyes to the world. You want empathy for people? Smoke a joint with two hookers who drive over two hours at 4.30 in the morning just to earn a living. Say what you want about morality, but that’s as real as it gets. All of sudden, 9-to-5 doesn’t seem so bad. Neither does the grumpy neighbor or that a-hole cousin. Plus, it’s quite liberating. You can say whatever you want. It’s all on the table. There’s nothing you can say that’s going to offend the underworld. What can be more extreme than the reality these two girls live?
Douglas Vigliotti
Perception is everything. If you see everything through the lens of the naysayers or through a victim perspective, then it’s hard to get what you really want in life.

Cultivating holistic wealth helps us to be mentally tough and to have grit to weather the inevitable storms and setbacks that life brings.

If we react to disruptions fearfully or habitually, or even non-strategically, then it’s almost impossible to achieve holistic wealth.
Keisha Blair
Your circumstances, your past choices, who you were back then, and even how people wish you to be now need not define you.
Keisha Blair
Your thought patterns can be a wellspring of abundance to live life on your terms. But negative talk and self-doubt are a drain on your inner resources.
Keisha Blair
The term naysayers is how I refer to the people and social forces who tap into negative thinking and undermine your belief in your own ability to create holistic wealth.
Keisha Blair
At a basic level, your personal mission has to be rooted in the story of you, the sum of your life experiences, and what you want to achieve in the future. It is like a blueprint for your life that is filled with action verbs and themes that you associate with achieving a sense of abundance, and which extends beyond material resources.

Once your passions are ignited, it becomes easier to find success in whatever field you choose.

Without spiritual self-renewal, it is extremely difficult to live within each moment. Without spiritual self-renewal, we live with the ghosts of the past and carry them with us to the future, effectively robbing ourselves of the present and never fulfilling our destiny and purpose.
Keisha Blair
It is easy to be carried away with ruminating about the past and worrying about the future. We waste precious seconds, minutes, hours doing this every single day. When we stop judging our experiences, we become less reactive and better able to tolerate difficulty.
Keisha Blair
Being present helps us slow down the experience of time and fully enjoy the gifts that are available now. Life, within each moment, contains an entire universe of riches.
Keisha Blair
Nothing is guaranteed in life. A whole life can be lost in minutes and can be wasted in the small moments missed. None of this is forever.

Sometimes we use the value that someone else gives us to determine the worth of ourselves and wonder why we fall short. When we cease listening to our own soul, we give our power away.

What do we owe the people who grew us up, who first made up our entire world? It's complicated for the kids of immigrants. I'm not talking about the usual "my parents don't understand" thing. My parents believe in the power of choice, and they never asked me to sacrifice my dreams for theirs. Yet I feel like I should anyway. Where does this feeling come from? Is it just loyalty and strong family ties? Is it because, as part of a marginalized community, we all had to stick together to survive, and that sort of experience tends to become habit? Maybe it's about guilt. We are kids who benefited from the sacrifices our parents made when they decided to move to a richer, safer country. If we then grow up to grow apart, have we become ungrateful villains?

What you deeply resent in another, is actually a reflection of what you wish you had or what you wish you could be. Resentful of how another speaks her mind? Because you were silenced and therefore fell silent. Resentful of how another wears (or doesn't wear) whatever she wants? Because you are controlled by your own ideas of morality and societal expectations. Resentful of how another's life is not constructed to pander and please others? Because you are bound by the cruel chains of people-pleasing, you don't know how to break out of. What you resent in others is what you actually wish you could be.
C. JoyBell C.
All pain comes from the distance between where you are now and where you want to be; from the distance between what you have and what you want; the difference between who you are now and who you wish to become. And all joy comes from the constant flow in the river of life: flowing with the reality of what is, right here and right now, and moving freely into wherever direction that river takes you. Control leads to pain because control assumes that one knows better than life itself.

A FRIENDSHIP LETTERIt's true! Friends, we choose them!There are different types of friends: childhood friend, first friend, school friend, work pal, ... Sometimes, we even nickname them as (my love, my life, my one, my all, ...); and yeah, it is good.Unfortunately, as human beings, everything comes to an end.But let me remind you that there is an other kind of friendship, an everlasting friendship that we find in Jesus Christ. He proved his friendship by sacrificing his life on the cross for his unknown friends and He is the one who choose us first!As I conclude, I like how we do our best for our friends. But as a piece of advice I can give, never disappoint your Eternal Friend Jesus Christ by pleasing your temporary friend!And around the corner, the Eternal Friend is coming back.Maranatha.

Todas las personas tienen un pasado. Cosas que se les clavan en el corazón. Antiguas rencillas. Antiguas humillaciones. Remordimientos que les roban el sueño y los dejan despiertos hasta que temen por su cordura. Traiciones que hacen que sus almas griten con tanta fuerzan que se preguntan cómo nadie más las es escucha. Al final, todos estamos solos en nuestros infiernos personales. Pero la vida no consiste en aprender a perdonar a quienes te han hecho daño ni olvidar el pasado. Consiste en aprender a perdonarte a ti mismo por ser humano y por cometer errores. Sí, la gente nos decepciona a todas horas. Pero las lecciones más duras nos llegan por decepcionarnos a nosotros mismos. Cuando depositamos nuestra confianza y nuestros corazones en las manos de la persona equivocada y nos hace daño. Y aunque podemos odiarlos por lo que nos hicieron, más nos odiamos a nosotros mismos por haber dejado entrar a esa persona en nuestro círculo privado.

BS Murthy
Seventeen years. Seventeen years since I pressed replay on my soul. Seventeen years of tears and ecstasies, lessons and experiences, dreams, disappointments, reality checks, and missed opportunities. Seventeen years of life. I have fallen in love with love, fell out of it, been repulsed by it, and fell back into it. Traveled the world, cultured my ignorant woes. Cruised to success, made wrong turns, slammed on my brakes, and speed to my temporary finish line. I have overflowed with rage and injustice, coping with my demons by burying my sorrows in worlds made of prose. I’ve created art from the lessons within those worlds and have laid my creations to rest. Learned the past is as terrifying as the future, but the future shines bright fore it can hold change in its’ palms. It’s been seventeen years since I pressed replay on my soul. Seventeen years full of guidance, love, heartbreak, joy, connections, and I still have a lifetime to fare.

Tulsi Bhagat
The last clear definite function of man - muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need - this is man. To build a wall, to build a house, a dam, and in the wall and house and dam to put something of Manself, and to Manself take back something of the wall, the house the dam; to take hard muscles from the lifring, to take the clear lines and form from conceiving. For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments.

Pieces of my self 
Debatrayee Banerjee
Pieces of my self. I have come to realise that our soul is not a static element or something that we can ever put in words. It is something that we find and embrace in bits and pieces flowing through an endless journey of life. Sometimes we find a halo of it in the setting sun while sometimes we chase its harmony in a distant sunrise. We have moments in Life, defining our traits, when some incident or some part of our Life changes forever rather takes shape forever but that too is not entirely rigid, they too flow with our soul and may be years or even moments later they change shape into something that twinkles more with our soul. It is a process of learning, unlearning and relearning where everything that we assemble in this Lifetime is like a free flowing river which meanders its way onto an ocean. And the ocean is Love. Not the Love that we often imagine it be, it is something beyond any imagination or definition. It is an air that absorbs every other force of Nature and releases them through the filter of Wisdom. It is about understanding our innermost fear and fighting it out with the indomitable courage that is always lurking in the deepest part of our heart. It is about knowing how contagious kindness can be and becoming the reflector of grace through our very existence. It is about embracing every chapter of our life with gratitude for the path that our spirit has chosen beyond boundaries and limits. It is about growing and healing. Growing through a voyage that is endless in this Cosmic ocean and healing through the balm of connections. I have realised that every connection that we make even if it is for a fraction of a second stays on within our soul and every alley that we explore leads us to a place that is closer to our destination. Sometimes the Destination gets blurred through the noises of all that is tangible in our surroundings and we often grow exhausted on this journey, it is then that we grow, trying to walk over a pyre of our failures, lost bonds, detours and everything that are capable of pulling us down they become stars, like the fireflies that show us the path to bring us closer to our soul, to put back the pieces of our self. They make us all that we stand as a whole. So especially when we run out of our strength somewhere in some hidden alley of our soul, something burns in our soul, a flicker of our passion guiding us home, where the pieces of our soul dance in a mad harmony to awaken the flame that lights our way onto a destination, wandering along the edge of a purpose that breathes through scattered pieces of our self, basking in the halo of eternity.

Ironically, introverts are the only ones who are able to be happy alone, without needing others to survive. They have strong individualistic traits and an in-built system that help them to depend on themselves. And without caring much about the validation of others.
Mitta Xinindlu
Introverts are not afraid to be 'weird' or 'odd-looking', to look different from the rest. They're not afraid to do their own thing, in their own pace. They don't succumb to peer/social pressure. Therefore, in my view, introverts are the strongest bunch of our society.
Mitta Xinindlu
We live in a world that discards the strengths and powers of introverts.

You define a person's character through observation in their actions, features, and traits for whom they have become. Assumptions are NOT facts, and you need to make an effort and get the truth before judging a person's character. If you don't, your perspective will be all wrong with fictional characters far from the truth in someone's else reality.

The Question:Everything is happening to or for us?The heart to heart note:Creators we be. Eventful, life is. And, agreeing to any perspective is as human as it gets. The push &amp; pull, rise &amp; descent, are marks of subjective positions: cognitively, psychologically, emotionally, and how we infuse our experiences with labels. So, everything is what we make it to be.

The last child must inherit all the great attributes of his elders, then add in some of his own characteristics to be completely unique from the rest.

We're sitting on a hill,reminiscing about our deeds.These are mesmerising moments of ease;scenes are harmonising in keys.But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.We think about the nice days from our teens; the things that we did at our free will.We're in sync with the future and past tensions. Indeed, we could enjoy the present intentions. But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.We envision our problems gone;with collisions exposed and pawned.Oh! We could enjoy this peaceful time,on this hill, watching the sunrise.But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.The beautiful birds stride pass our face.Thick cuticles blurred, striped by hours of grace.They flap their wings, forming art;tail lamps for us, bleeding hearts.But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.People of different cultures come to us.Simple, they offer their services; no Judas.Wave their hands with care; give their food to share.But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.What a sad case this is; our mindfulness is butchered.Heads are swimming between the past and the future.Opportunities to love others in truth are being missed.Communities could share true love; limiting the rifts.But we're in a state of oblivion,shunned from the view of fate in this period.

Forgiveness invigorates, grudges wear out
Rafsan Al Musawver
I have never feared death and never had in mind it existed. The last few days have taught me the most significant lessons of my life. No matter how I led my life, being lost in the realm of euphoria or being so engaged in the most intricate process of earning a livelihood, death has always been there. Having said that, it remains trifling until the day life takes a toll on you. Sometimes, life hits hard to remind you of the fact that it doesn't like your sole obsession with living. It persuades you to remember death so that you can realize the true value of being alive. Love your life and respect death
Rafsan Al Musawver
Forgiveness is a thing that we invariably love to receive. But when it comes to giving, it becomes intimidating. It causes distress, brings about the apprehension of losing something huge. Subconsciously, we fret about losing our grudges. Long ago, we found bliss in petting animosity.

Home was perhaps just this body I inhabited and this too was alien to me at times, its folds and creases, its pains and needs. Home was everywhere andnowhere. Home, I realised now, was anywhere the heart slept in peace. Home was where one unpacked one’s cares and settled them into the wardrobe with one’s clothes. It was where one was complete.
Kiran Manral
There was a purgatory on earth that we theliving wandered into, clinging on to the memories of the person, breathing in the clothes still hanging in the closet until timegently ameliorates their fragrance, blending it into the sameness of air. Our ghosts resided there, in that closet. Few of us hadthe courage to shut that door, to lock it, to never peep into it again, to let the ghosts swirl within the closed confines desperatefor release. We kept returning to peek into those closets in our heads, we kept letting our ghosts out.

How many cups of beverages do you take on a typical day?Warren Buffet made 15 colossal mistakes that could ruin his investor career.

i'm looking for the face i had before the world was made.I was the primordial flaring forth, the gravitational waves, the whirling galaxies, and the exploding supernovas that would become stars and planets. I was the steaming planet Earth, the bacteria awash in the sea, and the early eukaryotes and multicellular animals. I exploded in the Cambrian explosion, stumbled onto land, walked with dinosaurs, saw trees and flowers appear, walked upright in Africa, and walked on the moon. I felt the embrace of gravity. I was one with all that had been and all that was to be. I experienced subjective mystical communion with the evolutionary, emergent universe. I was the universe. We know not where the journey leads, nor whether a final destination is even a meaningful concept. The attraction is the inherent thrill of participating in a grand creative endeavor for which participation is its own reward

Words are life. Words are light. Words are power. Words are energy. Words are truth. Words can enliven and words can also kill. Words can give hope, or plunge us into despair. People use words to build peace, and use words to make war. Words can create walls between cultures, religions, and nations. And words can also build bridges. The existence of an individual, a family, a community, a country, and our planet is being led to good or to evil through the power of the words we speak. The words we speak are responsible for everything that happens in this world. We, therefore, must be responsible for the words we speak. On behalf of future generations, I hope that each of us will do all we can to speak only bright, light-filled words, so that one day, our descendants will be born into a world filled with light. There is no time to lose. Starting at this very moment, I hope all of us will take a close look at the words we have been using and make constant efforts to fill them with brightness.

The saddest steak is on the grill, its juices bleeding and sizzling into the fire. Death never tasted so good as a last meal. You once were admired, until she left when you couldn't fit through the door anymore. The mirror last laughs as your skin runs over the edges. One hand feeds time, the other hand scratches the face of the clock, swallowing the past. As the mirror smashes, the piano keys the car, and pieces reflect the thinner you once again.

She tries to walk not too fast and not too slow. She doesn't want to attract any attention. She pretends she doesn't hear the whistles and catcalls and lewd comments. Sometimes she forgets and leaves her house in a skirt or a tank top because it's a warm day and she wants to feel warm air on her bare skin. Before long, she remembers. She keeps her keys in her hand, three of them held between her fingers, like a dull claw. She makes eye contact only when necessary and if a man should catch her eye, she juts her chin forward, makes sure the line of her jaw is strong. When she leaves work or the bar late, she calls a car service and when the car pulls up to her building, she quickly scans the street to make sure it's safe to walk the short distance from the curb to the door. She once told a boyfriend about these considerations and he said, 'You are completely out of your mind.' She told a new friend at work and she said, 'Honey you're not crazy. You're a woman.
